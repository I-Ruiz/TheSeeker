# Weapons & Crafting

Weapons and Weapon Crafting are currently at a very exeperimental idea stage.

The overall goal for those would be to make weapons not drop as loot, but instead to make them primarily obtainable through crafting.

The goal here is to create a sense of realism - alien creatures shouldn't be dropping guns and swords as loot.

Instead, enemies will drop various materials, and the player will be able to craft weapons from those.

The idea for the crafting, is to go nuts with a function-based 'signal flow' idea.

A crafting window will look similar to node-based programming environments like Touch Designer.

The player will always start with a single initial node that will signify their weapon type, let's say a Bow.

Now this Bow will have a single output, signfying an arrow.

Then, you might connect that output to a 'Splitstone' that you acquire as loot from some strange alien creatures.

This Splitstone will split the arrow into 3 smaller arrows, leading to 3 separate outputs that can be processed independently.

Then, you might decide to apply 'Volcaning Shard' on the first output, which will make this arrow burn

Then, apply some other modifier on the second arrow that makes it ricochet whenever it hits walls

Then, you might even apply Splitstone once again on the third arrow, leading to 3 new arrows coming out of that one!

We could even have modifiers that introduce 'delay' (making the effect happen after some duration instead of immediately), or modifiers altering the angle of projectiles, etc.

If you want your Bow to shoot out a perfeclty fine tuned sequence of arrows that spells out some words on the screen, you could (technically) do it!

The only limitation to how crazy you can get with crafting these will be:
- how many crafting materials you can acquire
- the total weight of the weapon

The weight means that the player will have a certain weight capacity stat, and different weapon modifiers will have different weight values. So creating very complex weapons will also make them weigh more, potentially making them un-equippable by the player.

Interestingly, the 'weight capacity' will be a stat that will also be modifiable by Passive Skills, leading to very interesting synergies.

Once again, this is a very experimental idea, so feel free to share your thoughts on our Discord.
