# Active Skills

Active skills are skills that need to be manually triggered by the player and have an active visual effect and usually come with their own animations. For example, a basic sword slash, or a spinning melee attack, or shooting guns, or a dash.

All active skills can either be used independently of the weapon the player uses (like a dash, or putting a turret on the ground), or they are dependent only on the category of the weapon: melee or ranged, and since the player always has 1 melee and 1 ranged weapon equipped, using those skills will automatically use the correct weapon.

So for instance, if you have a 'spinning melee attack' equipped and you have a hammer in your melee weapon slot, you will start spinning with a hammer.
But if you use this attack while having a sword in your melee weapon slot you will start spinning with a sword.

This means there's no need to ever manually swap your weapons, and all skills you equip will always be available to you.


There will be a long list of skills to choose from (aiming for at least 30), and you will be able to equip 4 of them at a time, leading to a lot of possible combinations.

Each skill will also have 3 variants:
- Regular (when pressing the skill button)
- 'Up' variant (when pressing the skill while holding Up key)
- 'Down' variant (whep pressing the skill while holding Down key)

So for example, a regular sword slash will slash forwards in its regular version, upwards in Up variant, and downwards in Down variant.
But, for skills that are not direction-based, this can be used for more interesting variants. For example, the regular version of Stealth skill might put you in stealth for a few seconds, but its Down variant might leave a shadow behind, and make you teleport back to the shadow when the stealth duration ends. There are no specific rules for how these variants should behave, other than they should be somewhat related to the regular version of the skill.

The way skills will be acquired has not been decided yet. In the near term we might just unlock a random skill every time the player levels up.
