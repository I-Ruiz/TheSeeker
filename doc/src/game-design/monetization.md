# Monetization


The Seeker is an entirely Open Source game, and as such does not have any traditional form of monetization.

That being said, there are 2 ways in which you can support the project, to help speed up and enhance the development progress:
- GitHub Donations
- Digital Collectibles (Ordinals)
<br><br>

**GitHub Donations**

This one is quite straightforward, you can donate to our project here:
[DONATIONS](https://github.com/sponsors/TheSeekerGame)

100% of the proceeds from donations will be used to improve the game.

Once we reach a comfortable threshold of donations we'll be able to also focus more on benefitting the broader game dev community through (for example) nicely packaged asset packs, level editor, bevy plugins, modding tools, tutorials, etc.

Donating will also give you some additional perks like the ability to put you name in our game credits. You can read more about this on our donations page.

**Digital Collectibles**

We use the [Ordinals](https://docs.ordinals.com/) protocol to create some really unique collectibles directly on Bitcoin.
They are created purely because it is really fun to create them, and since the Ordinals protocol is highly focused on nerdy details, there's a lot of inspirational synergy with our mathematically inspired game.

They don't have any gatekeeping / P2W function in our game (we can't possibly do that, it's all open source).

We are not creating a crypto game, you can view our collectibles as just 'nerdy digital merch'.

We *might* do a light integration of collectibles with our game, in the form of *environmental interaction*. For example, if you own a collectible version of a vagrant merchant, you will be able to determine that position of that merchant in the game world (where local game clients can *opt-in* to do a basic api call to check some blockchain data that determines the merchant's position). This could lead to exciting community interactions without any P2W or gatekeeping of content.

From the perspective of project support, buying one of our collectibles is pretty much the same as donating, except here you also get something cool to commemorate your contribution.

Since we also pay all contributors directly in Bitcoin (it's much easier and more inclusive) funds from collectible sales also spare us some conversion + platform fees. It's very p2p in that way.

Ordinals also offer very easy integration with Discord, where bots can be used to detect ownership of collectibles and automatically assign special roles that unlock access to private channels - this could be used as a great Patreon replacement, where our supporters can chat with us and suggest ideas more directly, while we don't have to rely on any 3rd party platform taking a large cut. Again, going back to the p2p idea.
